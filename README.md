Introduction
============
This is my submission for project 6 of [Udacity's Nanodegree in Front-End Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). It contains a set of tests written with the Jasmine library to test the functionality of a News feed reader.


###Version number and release date
This is version 1.0, published on 18 October 2015.


###Credits and contact
The original feed reader was provided by Udacity. All except the first test suite in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js have been added by me (Said Khalid Scharaf). You can reach me at sks@posteo.de
